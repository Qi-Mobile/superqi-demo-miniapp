# Sample Mini App

A sample mini application that demonstrates integration with SuperQi's mini app platform, featuring a Go backend with Alipay API integration and an H5 frontend.

## Examples

- [authCode](/frontend/authCode.html) - Depending on the usecase, this is usually the first function to execute when opening a Miniapp, it's used to authenticate the customer
- [chooseImage](/frontend/chooseImage.html) - This shows how the image picket works!
- More to come soon...
